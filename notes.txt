Bayesian apparatus:
	* model
	* sample space
	* hypothesis space
	* prior probabilities
	* sampling distribution

Principle of maximum entropy: (no model, just data)
	* sample space

If we hope to detect any phenomenon, than we must use a model that at least allows the possibility that it may exist.
A false premise built into a model which is never questioned cannot be removed by any amount of new data.

No argument is stronger than the premises that go into it.

The Basic Desiderata:
	1  Degrees of plausibility are represented by real numbers
		infinitesimal continuity is respected
		and p(A|BC) is UNDEFINED when BC is contradictory
	2  Qualitative correspondence with common sense (> < directions)
	3a If a conclusion can be reasoned out in more than one way, then every possible way must lead to the same result.
	3b The robot is completely non-ideological.
		The robot always takes to account ALL the evidence it has relevant to a question,
		it does not arbitrarily ignore some of the information, basing its conclusion only on what remains.
	3c The robot always represents equivalent states of knowledge by equivalent plausibility assignments.
		That is, if in two problems the robot's state of knowledge is the same (except perhaps
		for the labeling of the propositions), then it must assign the same plausibilities in both.
