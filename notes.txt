Bayesian apparatus:
	* model
	* sample space
	* hypothesis space
	* prior probabilities
	* sampling distribution

Principle of maximum entropy: (no model, just data)
	* sample space

If we hope to detect any phenomenon, than we must use a model that at least allows the possibility that it may exist.
A false premise built into a model which is never questioned cannot be removed by any amount of new data.

No argument is stronger than the premises that go into it.
